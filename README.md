Firstly, these are the main files that should be inside (additional files will not affect any of the main files):
1) HDBData.csv
2) cleanedHDB.csv
3) DataCleaning.py
4) PreprocessingData.py
5) DecisionTree.py*
6) RandomForest.py
7) NeuralNetwork.py
8) SVMModel.py
9) SVRModel.py
10) ComparingModels.py
----------------------------
Secondly, HDBData.csv is the original dataset from HDB Gov website, PreprocessingData.py consist of a graph visualising the resale price of HDB before implementing any algorithm for comparison purposes.
Thirdly, Run each algorithm following their file name individually to see its implementation and performance.
Lastly, ComparingModel.py is an overview of the overall 3 algorithm we chosen to compare and analyse.
*DecisionTree.py was a test algorithm we tried initially, however we decided not to include it in our slides for concise purpose
